subtitle: My interest in eTextiles

I'm taking this course in order to gain a deeper understanding of simple coding, which I plan on applying within my artistic pratice within the future. I'm always interested in opening up new avenues for myself to pursue, and this course is going to be the starting point for me to explore the interaction between technology and art, which I believe gets at the deeper question of the presence of humanity in art and humanity in technology. Being able to code little motors, or sensors which create sound or light each time they're passed, or the hundreds of other simple things that I'll be able to code by the end of the course, and then connecting it to sewing, a newfound passion of mine, excites me greatly.
