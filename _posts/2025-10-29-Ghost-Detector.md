We used temperature and light detectors in this assignment to detect the presence of ghosts....who make the room dark and cold. If the temperature read on the sensor went below a predetermined value (and the same for the light) two red onboard LEDs would turn on to alert the user of the presence of a ghost.

I think my advice to myself would be to play around a bit more with the values that I've determined for dark and cold. I set them too low for fear of them accidentally triggering without me doing anything, but then I had to have the sensor halfway outside of my window to get the temperature cold enough to turn the lights on. I instead could have just raised the threshold. Oh well! I enjoyed the process.
