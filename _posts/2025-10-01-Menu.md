In this assignment, we used C to create a variable menu, using nested if statements. There were two menus, one regular and one secret, which depended on an input of an even or odd integer.

Regular Menu Example :

Option Outside of Menu:

This assignment wasn't so bad...unlike another assignment this week...which troubled me greatly. If I could give one piece of advice to myself, it would be to organize the sections of the menu earlier, in the coding process. I added them towards the end, and it made everything that I was doing much clearer. Nice to be organized.
