This week we learned about arrays, which felt like taking another step in the direction that functions had taken us last week. We had to create a program which gives random brightness values to random PWM pins on our Lilypad, toggling them on or off, depending on their last state.

My advice for this project (with Pixel) would be to get a good grasp on the syntax of your assignment before attempting it - a lot of coding is just understanding syntax. For some reason when I think about it in that manner, it makes everything seem more maneagable.
