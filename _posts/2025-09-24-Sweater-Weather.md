In this assignment, we used C (for the second time) to practice using conditional statements in regard to what weather is sweater appropriate. We had to use an if statement, an else if statement, and an else statement. Below are images of each of my outputs.

Temperature Above 70 degrees

A tip that I would like to give to myself (the person I was before I started this assignment) is to be more flexible in regards to coding. I was troubled by the fact that I couldn't get any of the Boolean statements to work within my code (I'm still troubled by it, I'll be visiting student help hours soon...), and I sat there frustrated for about a half hour. Eventually, I figured out a work around that was quite simple, which I could have tried much earlier in the process and saved myself a good amount of frustration. There's always many ways to get to a result that you're looking for with coding, and sometimes it takes a few different variations to get what you want. I'll do my best to remember that.
