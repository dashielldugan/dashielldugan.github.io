This project came about out of my need for a timer to keep track for me as the time goes by while I meditate. I've fallen into the habit of falling asleep while I meditate (though perhaps this is just a problem at the end of the semester), so I decided that I could use my knowledge from the semester to create a meditation timer in the shape of a duck, just for the fact that I enjoy ducks and I thought that it would be a nice piece of decoration when not in use. 

The duck was constructed from the following materials:
Arduino Lilypad ProtoSnap+
Arudino Lilypad Yellow LED (2)
Arudino Lilypad RGB LED
Arduino Lilypad Buzzer
Arduino Lilypad Light Sensor
Arduino Lilypad Switch
Conductive Thread
Red Embroidery Thread
Herringbone Fabric
Green Fabric
Cream Fabric
Sewing Needle
Stuffing (Old Paper and Hay)

Below, I've included an image of a paper prototype of my project. Here, I took time to plan out the underlying circutry of the duck, as well as the overall form. The conductive thread wiring was all done in quite close quarters, so I paid extra attention in creating a plan for the direction of all of my stitches, trying to minimize overlap and conserve thread as much as possible. I've learned that the less conductive thread you use, the less chances there are for faulty wiring in the final version of the project. I would say this is my first piece of advice to my past self - try to make the circuts absolutely as efficent as possible. It will save you both time and resources.

The first version of my project presents itself as such: The light detector here is detecting too much light, leaving the buzzer and the RGB LED Off. The switch under the wing is also set to off, thus all components on the duck are silent at the moment.

In the second photo, the light detector has still detected too much light, leaving the buzzer and RGB LED off, though the switch has been set to ON, turning on the two yellow LEDs in the eye of the duck. I put these LEDs in the eyes of the duck in hopes of getting more use out of it - as much as I enjoy meditating, I don't necessarily do it as often as I'd like (though I do hope this duck helps to reverse that). With these LEDs in the eyes, I think this duck can serve as a very low-level lamp at night, with a soothing warm light.

In the third and fourth photo below, I show what happens to the RGB LED when the light sensor has determined the room to be dark enough. The LED cycles through a pattern of various colors, meant to be a source of relaxtion through one's shut eyelids, like nice background noise. Instead, the lights are a bight brighter than I'd have liked - they can be a little bit of an annoyance. My second piece of advice thus is that I wish I had spent more time with the length and intensity of this LED pattern. I would like for it to slowly flow in and out of nice warm orange and red and white tones. I still enjoy what I've designed, though I do wish that it was a bit more relaxing.

My last (and final) piece of advice relates to something grander I've gathered from this course, which is that I need to approach new topics with more patience in the future. There were times in this course where I felt completely out of my comfort zone, and then eventually whatever topic I was having difficulty with would become another tool that I had to create new code. I always ended up enjoying the projects in the course more if I approached them from a patient state of mind. Hopefully this duck will help me be more patient in the future!
