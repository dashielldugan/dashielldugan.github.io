We used C in order to simulate the outcome of our plushy circut assignment. The results depended on the button and switch being pressed on or off, and the output was in reference to the LEDs.

This assignment really got me. I'm not even sure what advice I could give to my past self, because I would hope to give it to myself now. I suppose I should see which assignment looks more difficult in the future and start there, so that I can reach out for help earlier when it's necessary.
