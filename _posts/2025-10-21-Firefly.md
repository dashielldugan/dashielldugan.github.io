This week (for our midterm) we started working with coding in Arduino in order to simulate the flashing pattern of three different fireflies, taking a state-based approach.

The first firefly was the "Flashbulb" firefly, which flashes for half a second every four seconds.

The second firefly was the "Big Dipper" firefly, which flashes once every three seconds starting at a minimum brightness and increasing towards a maximum, the brightness increasing every 0.1 second. It then turns off once the maximum brightness is reached, and begins the cycle again after three seconds.

The third firefly (tricky) was the "Synchronous" firefly, which flashes three times (seperated by 0.1 seconds) every ten seconds.

This project was the culmination of all of the coding projects that we've done up until this point in the semester. It took a lot of detailed planning - figuring out what the states that we are trying to catch, what variables we need, figuring out how to implement those basic ideas into more complicated code. It really pays off to be meticulous in the planning stage, I would say that's where a majority of the work from this project really came from. My advice for other students beginning this project would be to have patience with it - split up the coding into multiple chunks of time. It keeps the frustration at bay, while also giving you time to reflect on what you're trying to do with the code. This was a tough assignment, but I'm glad that I got through it - I feel like I know Arduino much better than before, and how to take a state-based approach to future assignments. Yay!
