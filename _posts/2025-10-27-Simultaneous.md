This assignment involved putting the past three firefly assignments (Flashbulb, Big Dipper, Synchronous) into one program, which runs all three simultaneously. Included below is a photo of two of the fireflies (Flashbulb and Big Dipper) flashing at the same time:

This assignment was simple, having taken a state-based approach as suggested by Professor Howley. Combining the seperate programs into one involved removing redundant integers and combining the programs under one void setup and void loop function. My advice, I suppose, would be to take better care of your Protosnap Plus device - I have to hold mine at a little split between the button and LEDs section at the bottom. I think there must be something I can do with alligator clips to fix this, but I haven't been sucessful so far. Also, take a state-based approach.
