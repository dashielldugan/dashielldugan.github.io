This project introduced us both to circutry, and to sewing with conductive thread. The sewing was a continuation from the sewing sampler that we did earlier in the semester; we used just whip stitch and running stitch for this project. I think that my consistancy is beginning to improve, though it isn't perfect (what is............?). We created a simple circut using three LED lights, a button, and a switch, sewing all upon the plushy. I had a great time with the circutry component of this project - I'm looking forward to doing a bit more in the future with it. The sewing was fun as always!

Some advice that I'd give myself, or another student who hasn't yet completed the project, would be to very carefully consider the conductive thread lines that will run throughout the project. To make sure that the positive sides of my thread didn't interact with the negative ends, I had to angle the thread on the front of the plushy in a strange direction to avoid any interaction on the inside. Some stuffing also might have helped with this. I think that good planning and patience is the key to doing well on projects in this class. Patience is a virtue!
