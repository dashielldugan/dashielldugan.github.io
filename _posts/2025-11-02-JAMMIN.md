In this assignment, we used the onboard buzzer (speaker) to play a short musical composition which we transcribed into Arduino. The transcription process was fun - I created notes using the frequencies that each note corresponds to, and note lengths, determined by how long each note would be delayed for. This assignment felt to me like coding the punchcards for an old music box; I really enjoyed myself. I might try to compose something for the final...

My advice for any students attempting to do this project would be to transcribe everything in order - set up your note values and lengths as constant integers, and then create your composition. The actual composition process is quite easy once all of the legwork is done.
