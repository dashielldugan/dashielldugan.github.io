We used C to create a loop which prints out three varying colors, depending on the time set in the variable. Every ten times through the code, it will print out a color of LED (Red, Green, Blue).

I need to start working on the coding assignments on Tuesday rather than Wednesday so that I can go to student help hours, I fear. I understood most of this assignment, but making a recursive loop seems to be beyond my abilities at the moment. Oh well...I will have it figured out by the next assignment. Coding comes slowly. Practice makes perfect. Patience is a virtue. Etc.
