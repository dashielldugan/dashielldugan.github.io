In this assignment, we created various functions in order to play two different morse code tracks on the arduino buzzer, depending on whether a switch was on or off. When the swtich is on, an SOS signal is played on the buzzer. If off, it spells out my name (DASH) in morse code.

My advice for students approaching this project would be to gather your variables before attempting to code. With an assignment like this, keeping track of various variables within various functions becomes complicated quite quickly.
