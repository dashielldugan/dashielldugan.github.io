I've been doing a lot with pattern blocks in junior seminar (arts 319) this semester, thus I decided to explore creating a schoolhouse quilt block this week. We're working with circuts, focusing on points where the circut can open and close. We must create two circut openings which we close using homemade switches.

The windows are cut out, with the light sewn in. The when the chimney is pushed down, which connects two conductive thread patches, and the door is shut, which connects some needles and a paperclip to a conductive fabric patch, the light will turn on.

I used some hidden stitches this week, which worked better than I was expecting to hide patches on the right side of the fabric, in order to hide the conductive steel thread.

I had two lights in the alligator clips photo, but I decided that the design would look better with one as the process continued.

My advice for this week would be to consider carefully what stitch types you'd like in the overall design. Perhaps my adivce is to make a thorough design.
