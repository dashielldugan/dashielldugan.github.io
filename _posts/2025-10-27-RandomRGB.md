In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a program that generates a random RGB value (using pins 12, 13, 14 on our Protosnap Plus). Below I've included various photos of the LED emitting various colors.

My advice would be to create a plan and test it out, and then keep an open mind and modify from what you have. For instance, I was able to get the LED lighting up at different values at first, but they were flashing so rapidly that the colors all showed as white. From there, I had to add various components to the code to keep it at one color per button press. I knew that this was the final goal, but I wasn't sure how to get there from the beginning. I think testing various things as you go along is an integral part of the coding experience that one has to expect and be prepared to accept (and hopefully enjoy).
